# Mini Games Collection ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the **Mini Games Collection** repository! This project showcases a selection of both classic and modern mini-games, all created using **Python** and **tkinter**. Each game is designed with an emphasis on **clean design**, **modern user interfaces**, and **fun gameplay**. Whether you're here to relive some nostalgic moments or just want a fun, interactive experience, these games are sure to entertain players of all ages.


## Features:
- **Modern UI**: Enjoy a clean, simple, and modern user interface powered by tkinter. The design prioritizes aesthetics while ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Multi-Difficulty Options**: Snake offers a choice of three difficulty levelsâ€”Easy, Medium, and Hardâ€”allowing players to enjoy the game at their preferred pace.
- **Responsive Controls**: Games are controlled via smooth keyboard input (Snake) or button clicks (Tic-Tac-Toe), offering a responsive and user-friendly experience.
- **Game Over Handling**: Once a game ends, you'll receive clear feedback on the result (win, loss, or draw), with an option to restart and try again without needing to reload the entire program.
- **Restartable Games**: Quickly restart each game with a single click, making it easy to jump back into the action.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary language for development.
- **tkinter**: A standard Python library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for these games.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the games in this collection:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Dilshan-Mindika/Mini-Games-Python.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The tkinter library comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.
3. **Run the game**: Navigate to the directory where the game files are stored and execute the Python script to launch the game.
